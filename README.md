# **Maze Game**

This project is a maze-solving game implemented in C++ that utilizes linked lists, queues, and graphs. The game allows users to play and solve mazes manually or use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to find the shortest path to the solution. Maze configurations are stored in text files, and the user can input custom mazes during gameplay.  

## **Data Structures Used:**  
- Linked List
- Queue
- Graph

## **Features**
- **Manual Maze Solving:**
   Users can navigate through mazes using the keyborad input to find the solution
- **DFS Algorithm:**
   The program includes a DFS algorithm to automatically find the shortest path to the solution.
- **Maze Storage:**
   Maze configurations are stored in text files for easy customization and expansion.
- **User-Played Mazes:**
   Users can input their own mazes for solving, enhancing the interactive experience.

## **Dependencies**
- C++ Compiler

Overall we tried to make it as user friendly we could. The source code is in the above uploaded files. We gave two maze stored in separate files but you can modify them according to your need and can also add more as they are simple text files that are read during the program run.
